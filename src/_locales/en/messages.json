It uses the browser's native JSON parser and a custom-built formatter to produce its output.\n\nNormally, the browser would either prompt to download or display as plain text any JSON sent with the correct application/json mime-type. JSONovich makes working with and debugging output from web services easier by formatting JSON nicely inside the browser.",
